# javaFxNetflix

Desktop application that works as a movie collection and movie player. It's developed in JavaFX, so much of the code here can be reused in similar projects.

Technologies used:
- Hibernate
- JavaFX
- PostgreSQL

Some of the functionalities follow:
- Add a movie from a local file
- Add a cover image
- List all movies
- Filter movies by parameters (generic and reusable method)
- Tables containing images (TableViews and GridPanes)
- Register new user 
- Login
- Movie player (Play,Pause,Stop,Forward_X_Seconds, increase playback speed, reduce playback speed, etc).

If you're interested in using the source code from this project and needs help with anything, just e-mail me. I'll answer within the day: `marcelluiz96@hotmail.com` or `marcelluiz960@gmail.com`
